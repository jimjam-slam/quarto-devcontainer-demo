This is a sample dev container! It's set up particularly for R and Quarto development.

To render this document, hit the Render button up the top-right of the tab in VSCode, or open a terminal with {{< kbd mac=Shift-Command-P win=Shift-Control-P linux=Shift-Ctrl-P >}} and run `quarto render`.

To customise the dev container, modify [devcontainer.json](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json).

Now, let's see what we can do. How about some R code?

```{r}
#| label: rtest

library(tibble)

mydata <- tibble(x = 1:10, y = x^2)
print(mydata)
ojs_define(mydata)
```

And we can take the data that we've exported with `ojs_define` and send it to an Observable chart:

```{ojs}
//| label: somechart

Plot.plot({
  marks: [
    Plot.barY(transpose(mydata), {
      x: "x",
      y: "y"
    })
  ]
})
```

Great!
