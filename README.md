# quarto-devcontainer-demo

This is a sample dev container! It's set up particularly for R and Quarto development.

If you're interested in learning more about using dev containers this way, check out [my blog post on the subject](https://jamesgoldie.dev/writing/dev-containers-in-r).

To customise the dev container, modify [devcontainer.json](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json).

Otherwise, open up a terminal or start editing R scripts or Quarto documents!
